		<h3>Topic of the bachelor thesis</h3>
		<p>The goal of this thesis is to develop an online flight navigation planning application (similar to NAV98) using Java EE 6 technologies and JBoss open-source projects.</p>

		<p>Based on the user input (the route, weather conditions and technical details of the plane) the application calculates for each part of the route the most suitable flight direction, assumed fuel consumption, duration and length.</p>

		<p>Student is supposed to learn basic Java EE 6 technologies (e.g. Java Security, RESTful Web Services, Java Persistence API, Enterprise Java Beans, Servlets). The application will be deployed on OpenShift to be publicly accessible.</p>
